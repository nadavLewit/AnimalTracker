# AnimalTracker
This project includes many different filters for the camera, including a vertical flip, a set threshold filter, which using the RGB values, splits everything that is above the threshold to white and everything below to black. Along with these simple ones, there are also more complex filters, such as the [convolution filter](https://medium.com/@ianormy/convolution-filters-4971820e851f#:~:text=Convolution%20Filters%20(also%20known%20as%20kernels)%20are%20used%20with%20images,a%20kernel%20and%20an%20image.), which involves a box blur and the use of kernels to sharpen the image. There is also the object tracker, which like its name suggests, is used to identify and track objects and return specific details about the desried object.
